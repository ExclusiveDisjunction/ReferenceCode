# CNTFinal
A final project for our Computer Networks course

The client is run from the `client_entry.py` file. This is needed, so that the modules can be resolved correctly.
The server is run from the `server_entry.py` file. This has the same reason as the client.
All testing is performed in the testing.py module. Each set of testing is separated into a function, or functions. 

This project serves as a reference to the work that we did, and is archived.
