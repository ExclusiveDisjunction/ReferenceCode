The basic editor is used to edit objects AFTER they have been appended. 

There are only a few parameters to edit: Title, Type, Creator, and Description. Notice: Some of the parameters will be locked depending on the Object Type.

For Memes, only the Type parameter is locked.
For Collections & Master Collections, Creator and Description are locked.

When you have finsished your wanted edits, press 'Append' to complete the editing.
