This editor is used to view all Collections & Master Collections from the session.

This is a variation of the All Objects Editor, that only shows all Collections & Master Collections. This only does not have the buttons on the side of the Tree View, and only shows Collections & Master Collections from the session, regardless of location.

When you select an object from the tree, the editor will pull up the information and display it as READ ONLY properties. When you click Edit Current, then it will open the selected object in the Basic Editor.

Unlike Manage Memes, you can delete the selected object.
