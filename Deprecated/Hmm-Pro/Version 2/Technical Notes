Phosphor.Tools: Changed Phosphor.KeyboardShortcut to require a delegate in it's initlizer, and changed Phosphor.KeyboardReg to use that delgate instead of a seprate list.
Phosphor.Tools: Phosphor.KeyboardReg.Remove(KeyboardShortcut) now returns List<T>.Remove() instead of defalut value of true.
HmPro.Files: Removed Library and moved all files to Master Project.
HmPro: Removed Property Ins.CurrentSession, and the folder current from the debug. This means the program now refrences Ins.CurrentLoaded as its base for information.
HmPro: Common now includes these new functions. Some functions were modifyed: 
	1. SaveAsCopy() - Saves a copy of the current session without loading it afterwards.
	2. SaveAs() - Without saving this current session, it copies it to the new location and then loads that new path.
	3. Append(Editors, bool = true) - Runs the actuall append actions. This is used by Append(Action, bool = true) and AppendAll(). 
	4. AppendAll() - It only retirives the open editors, and then proccesses them using Append(Editors, bool = true).
	5. NewFile() - Creates a new Session/Segment. This is the new standard for making new files.
	6. OpenFile() - Opens a File. This replaced Main.OpenFromPath(string). This is the new standard for making new files.
	7. Save() - Removed.
HmPro: Modifyed HmPro.Ins:
	1. Added Property Ins.BasicSegment that contains the path for the basic segment template.
	2. Removed Property Ins.CurrentSession (Reinstated)
	3. Ins.IsLoaded now tests to see if the path supplied in Ins.CurrentLoaded exists.
	4. Ins.CurrentLoaded now does not copy the location to CurrentSession, part of the new file saving arcetecture. 
	5. Moved to Namespace HmPro instead of HmPro.Scripting.
Phosphor.Tools: Modifyed Phosphor.KeyboardRegEvent and Phosphor.BlankVoid to have 'object sender' as their first argument.
HmPro: Modifyed HmPro.Windows.Main:
	1. Added to the Ins_Loaded() and Ins_Unloaded() event procedures to lock and unlock, respectivly.
