## Layout
1. Hmmm Pro's (represented as HmPro in scripting) is organised into some units. Here is the current list:
	1. HmPro (Contains App and Enums)
	2. HmPro.Properties (unused by me)
	3. HmPro.Scripting (Ins, Files, Events, and Functions)
	4. HmPro.Windows (Contains all WPF windows.)
2. The subnamespaces are:
	1. HmPro
	2. HmPro.Properties
	3. HmPro.Scripting
	4. HmPro.Scripting.Events (Contains the event classes for saving, connec)
	5. HmPro.Scripting.Files (Manages *.teh files)
	6. HmPro.Scripting.Functions (Contains KeyboardCtrls, the common class for evaluating keyboard shortcuts.)
	7. HmPro.Scripting.Functions.Edit (Contains EditorReg, or Editor Registry, the core class for Actions and Editors in Main.)
	8. HmPro.Windows (Contains Main)
	9. HmPro.Windows.Interaction (Contains Startup, About, & Tour)
	10. HmPro.Windows.Editing (Contains ObjectSelector, ImportExport, MemeRegulations, & ScriptEditor)

Some functions in the program require the usage of Lyseria.Tools, which is a basicl library. Hmmm Pro 2019.1 uses Lyseria.Tools 1.4.4.0.
File Parsing is in the assembly HmPro.Files. Hmmm pro 2019.1 uses HmPro.Files 1.0.0.0.
	
## Files & Types
1. Registered File Types:
	1. *.teh (Session)
	2. *.tehs (Settings)
	3. *.tehst (Text Settings)
	4. *.tehed (Editor Configuration)
2. HmPro's files are stored in the bin/Debug folder, and when published, this is taken with it. The app's data is stored here. These are the folders:
	1. action (Not used in this version, in prep for next version.)
	2. assets (The stored templates, not used for this version.)
	3. crash (The stored crashes, not used much.)
	4. current (Stores the CurrentSession when loaded.)
	5. doc (Contains documentation information.)
	6. instance (Contains app settings.)
	7. template (The templates of the program.)
	8. template/session (Specific templates of session files.)
	9. template/setting (Specific templates of settings files.)
3. And these are the files:
	1. action/Action7.tehed
	2. action/Action6.tehed
	3. action/Action5.tehed
	4. action/Action4.tehed
	5. action/Action3.tehed
	6. action/Action2.tehed
	7. action/Action1.tehed
	8. instance/dir.tehst
	9. instance/editor.tehs
	10. instance/file.tehst
	11. instance/ins.tehs
	12. instance/recent.tehs
	13. template/session/basic.teh
	14. template/setting/instance.tehs
	15. template/setting/recent.tehs
	16. template/setting/text.tehst

	Each file serves it's own job. The files in doc/ are not listed, as that is for documentation and takes up too many lines. 

## Graphics
	All graphics are made by Hollan C. Sellars, aka ExclusiveDisunction. Inkscape used for creating all logos.
	*Notice*: All graphics, *.svg and *.png are stored in directory 'graphics', repspectivly.

## Windows & Management
	Main - as the name implies, this is loaded after Startup. This controls most of the user's interactions.
	Startup - also as the name implies, this loads directly after the app does. If the app tells this that there is a file opened from an external source, then it loads that file.
	Object Selector - used to select an object from a filter, and return it's component.
	ImportExport - Used for importing or exporting assets.
	Meme Regulations - Used to set the rules for making memes. Not used in this release.
	Tour - only runs if Ins.FirstTime, but it shows you how to use the app.
	Documentation - Documentation.
