# ExDisj's Reference Code

This is a central repository that contains most of the random, silly, or non-practical projects are stored. Here you can find the following things:

1. Armin -> A link to the Armin repository. This is a submodule.
2. Foundations -> A link to the Foundations library. This is a submodule.
3. Hmm-Pro -> A link to Hmm-Pro. This is a submodule.
4. braille -> A project that contains two programs, Braille Pro, and Braille Typewriter. Braille Typewriter is a GUI that simulates a brailler on the screen. It operates by recoring keystrokes from the sdf & jkl keys. Braille Pro is a software that allows for quizzing and learning of braille symbols. 
5. Calculators -> A collection of various calculators and calculation software. Some code is repeated, but most of the software does its own functions. The calc project contains a skeleton, unfished software that would unify the code. This has been replaced by the Jason project, at https://github.com/ExclusiveDisjunction/Jason
6. Graphics -> Contains various Direct2d and Direct3d projects that served as learning examples.
7. Win-Socket -> A small program for connecting a server and client using the windows socket implementation.

These projects will most lilkey not be updated. This serves to show progress in coding, and keep code together for future reference.
